Gather more image icons and sort them 
  Make hovering over the icon transition in a floating box that says the name and nutritional composition of the item

Make hovering over a subsection of the bar also have the same information appear

draw a line connecting the selected sections from each bar

Do additive selection / toggling when clicking again, make the added selections accumulate into a seperate bar 
to show the macro distribution of all those items. 

maybe add ability to save accumulated selection and compare it to another accumulated selection. 

Add labels (fat, carbs, protein, sodium)

Add scales / axes (make sure it's clear what the sodium scale is)

Make buttons look like tabs, and indicate which is selected.
